## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/edu010101/adk-extra-services.git
   cd adk-extra-services
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Run tests:**
   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

5. **Code formatting:**
   We use `black`, `isort`, and `flake8` for code style. Run the autoformatter:
   ```bash
   ./autoformat.sh
   ```
   This will automatically format your code and organize imports.
